My vision when making this website about myelf was about photography. I wanted 3 simple and easy to navigate pages.
These pages were made to show people about my photography and myself. My contact page was designed so that people could easily
send me a message. I did not provide my number because I did not want people calling me, but I will certainly put it on there
when and if I go into this business. I made my logo a moving animation along a bright underline to grab the user's attention.

I did not include the prices page in my for my 3 page mock-up.
