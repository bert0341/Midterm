                Hi, my name is Erik Bertelsen and I love the outdoors. I was born in Huntsville Ontario and have spent most of my childhood in the Florida Everglades during the winter time. Being exposed to all different types of nature at a young age had a profound affect on how I see things. Through my photography and videography I attempt to share my vision of the natural world and all of the miracles it has to offer. Please enjoy my gallery, and I invite you to view the options for private photography tours that may appeal to you as a beginner or advanced photographer.

                About My Logo
            </h2>
            <!-- descritption of my logo -->
            <p class="pad">
                I designed my logo as a Viking.  My reason for this is because of my Danish heritage. I was named after the famous Viking explorer Erik The Red who discovered Greenland. Erik the Red serves as a visual symbol that is easily recognizable and stands for the spirit of exporation and adventure.
